# Data Science 410: Programming Models for Big Data
This repository contains coursework, projects, and implementations developed for DS410 Programming Models for Big Data at Penn State. The course focuses on modern programming models and frameworks for scalable data analytics and discovery on massive and high-dimensional datasets.

Topics covered include:

-MapReduce and distributed data processing

-Data flow models for cluster computing

-Large-scale clustering techniques

-Scalable algorithm design for aggregation, iteration, and statistical modeling

The projects in this repository demonstrate the use of these frameworks to build and optimize data analytic workflows for large datasets, emphasizing performance, scalability, and practical application of big data concepts.
